/// An annotated simple subscribe/publish usage example for mqtt_server_client. Please read in with reference
/// to the MQTT specification. The example is runnable, also refer to test/mqtt_client_broker_test...dart
/// files for separate subscribe/publish tests.

/// First create a client, the client is constructed with a broker name, client identifier
/// and port if needed. The client identifier (short ClientId) is an identifier of each MQTT
/// client connecting to a MQTT broker. As the word identifier already suggests, it should be unique per broker.
/// The broker uses it for identifying the client and the current state of the client. If you don’t need a state
/// to be hold by the broker, in MQTT 3.1.1 you can set an empty ClientId, which results in a connection without any state.
/// A condition is that clean session connect flag is true, otherwise the connection will be rejected.
/// The client identifier can be a maximum length of 23 characters. If a port is not specified the standard port
/// of 1883 is used.
/// If you want to use websockets rather than TCP see below.

Future<int> main() async {
  /// A websocket URL must start with ws:// or wss:// or Dart will throw an exception, consult your websocket MQTT broker
  /// for details.
  /// To use websockets add the following lines -:
  /// client.useWebSocket = true;
  /// client.port = 80;  ( or whatever your WS port is)
  /// There is also an alternate websocket implementation for specialist use, see useAlternateWebSocketImplementation
  /// Note do not set the secure flag if you are using wss, the secure flags is for TCP sockets only.
  /// You can also supply your own websocket protocol list or disable this feature using the websocketProtocols
  /// setter, read the API docs for further details here, the vast majority of brokers will support the client default
  /// list so in most cases you can ignore this.

  /// Create a connection message to use or use the default one. The default one sets the
  /// client identifier, any supplied username/password and clean session,
  /// an example of a specific one below.

  // /// Publish it
  // print('EXAMPLE::Publishing our topic');
  // client.publishMessage(pubTopic, MqttQos.exactlyOnce, builder.payload!);

  // /// Ok, we will now sleep a while, in this gap you will see ping request/response
  // /// messages being exchanged by the keep alive mechanism.
  // print('EXAMPLE::Sleeping....');
  // await MqttUtilities.asyncSleep(60);

  // /// Finally, unsubscribe and exit gracefully
  // print('EXAMPLE::Unsubscribing');
  // client.unsubscribe(topic);

  // /// Wait for the unsubscribe message from the broker if you wish.
  // await MqttUtilities.asyncSleep(2);
  // print('EXAMPLE::Disconnecting');
  // client.disconnect();
